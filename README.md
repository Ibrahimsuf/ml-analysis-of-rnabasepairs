# Zhong Lab Research (2023)

This repo includes all the code and data from my time at the Zhong Lab at the University of Kansas. The project focuses on classifying RNA base pairs and base stacks with machine learning. Current models struggle with **noncanonical** base pairs, so this work aims to make those predictions more accurate.
